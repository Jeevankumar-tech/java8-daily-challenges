# Group Anagrams Problem

## 📜 Description
Given a list of strings, group the strings that are **anagrams** of each other.

An **anagram** is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word, using all the original letters exactly once.  
Example:  
- `"listen"` → `"silent"`  
- `"eat"` → `"tea"`, `"ate"`

Your task is to group words that are anagrams into separate lists.
